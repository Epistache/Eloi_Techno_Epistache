## What is this folder for ?
In your project or package.
Create a "Resources" folder.

In this folder, you can name a folder for where we can load the prefab of your room.
A option in the default folder allows to only see room under:
- Prototype : You are working on it.
- Showable : Start to be showable but still not finish
- Release : It is finish and you want to show your room to the community

If you build your own Magic Room project, you can load other type of folder name.
